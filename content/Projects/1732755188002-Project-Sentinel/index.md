Great Tree Games is working together with Theory of Games to bring climate fiction to life! The world of Project Sentinel (working title) is a peek at the terrible and beautiful world that might await us in the future of climate change on earth. Great Tree Games has been working with narrative designers and artists on the creation of many different prototypes of this narrative focused title. Preproduction has now finished, and Great Tree Games is working with award-winning designer Keith Burgun on spearheading development.
