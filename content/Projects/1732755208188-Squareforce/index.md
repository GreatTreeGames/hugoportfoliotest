It's hip to be square! Inspired by Smash-Likes and Platform Fighters, Squareforce is a flying fighting game where you can build your own moveset and duke it out in 2.5d spaceship combat. Powered by the mysterious Squareforce, each spacecraft can equip up to 6 moves that have different strengths and weaknesses, and players assemble their character's kits as part of the game's strategy. Squareforce put Great Tree Games on the map as a studio when players at Indypopcon and GDEX took notice.
