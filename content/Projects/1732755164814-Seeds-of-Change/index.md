Seeds of Change is a project currently developed by a team of dedicated volunteers, with Great Tree Games offering core development and design services! This ambitious mobile title seeks to drive climate action through the creation of a socially focused mobile game, where players complete climate actions in real life to progress in an expressive farm sim with their friends.
