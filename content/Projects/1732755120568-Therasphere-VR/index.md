Great Tree Games worked once again with Razoredge to deliver a VR experience for an academic client- the Therasphere training game involves the detailed setup of an experimental cancer treatment device. Importantly, this training ensures that expensive time and energy needed to train medical staff on this delicate procedure can be done virtually, anytime, and anywhere, speeding up training and lowering cost.
