Great Tree Games has worked with Razoredge, a VR studio in Cleveland, to bring Future of Pet to life. This VR experience is designed to show future developments in the pet food industry and inform those in the field of current developments towards adaptive and pet-aware technologies they might be working with in the coming years. In this first version of several, we focus on the character Sam as she addresses her pet catâ€™s changing needs.
