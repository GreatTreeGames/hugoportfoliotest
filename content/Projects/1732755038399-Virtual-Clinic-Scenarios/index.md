Great Tree Games has worked in partnership with Case Western Reserve University and the MinuteClinics in CVS and Target locations to create a set of virtual scenarios for nurse practitioners, collectively called The Virtual Clinic. The lessons consist of multiple serious games, as well as written material, all available as part of a learning management system available for employee access. The goal of the Virtual Clinic is to teach the Age-Friendly Health Systems 4Ms framework to nurse practitioners and physician associates who staff MinuteClinics around the country. The first of these two serious games, Virtual Clinic Scenarios, was released first.
