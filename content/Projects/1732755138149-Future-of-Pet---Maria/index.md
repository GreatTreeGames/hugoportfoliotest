This was another VR game made for the same purpose as FOP Sam. this time, we targeted a different set of products and a different set of potential customers to feature in the game. As before, the idea is to show a few interactive scenes of the future of pet care, prominently featuring products only just starting to be developed today, and to get marketing and sales specialists aquainted with the vision of the company. This pet care company was a client of RazorEdge LLC, a VR-focused serious games company that I did intermittent contract work with from 2021-2023.


# ENGINEERING TASKS:


## Gameplay Systems Programming

I took on a more central role this time as the engineer on this project, with razoredge's other engineer only helping a little bit. As before, I programmed all of the gameplay that occurred in between the timeline sections, including the digital interfaces, 'virtual' vr headset, and interactions with the dog character. 

## Unity Timeline Sequencing and Art Pipeline

I configured all of the content in the game as well, mostly making use of unity timeline and figma. I had more work to do in figma this time as our client's brand identity requirements were abit more strict. I ended up handling most of the 2d art pipeline myself. However, when working on the 3d art pipeline, there was a last minute emergency issue with animations on the dog character! I was able to make it work with unity timeline anyway, however I now know that sometimes unity timeline doesn't treat different animation's offsets the same way.
